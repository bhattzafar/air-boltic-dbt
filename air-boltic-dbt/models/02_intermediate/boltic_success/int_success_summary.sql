MODEL: fact_success_summary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grain: 1 row per snapshot date (event-level metric rollups)

This model provides a longitudinal summary of Air Boltic's overall business
performance across different metrics (revenue, trip volume, utilization, etc.),
calculated on a daily rolling basis.

Unlike static metrics based on CURRENT_DATE, this design introduces a dynamic
date spine to simulate daily snapshots â€” allowing us to observe performance
across all historical events (trips/orders).
